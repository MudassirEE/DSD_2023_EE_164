The compiler(vlog/vcom) -nopsl switch disables any embedded PSL
parsing - this will prevent parsing of any code within
the PSL metacomment - including any HDL code in the metacomment.
It has no effect on the vunit parsing in any way. If you provide
a vunit file using the -pslfile switch then the entire vunit
will get and code will be generated for it.

If you simulate with the vsim -nopsl switch, evaluation of all PSL
assume/assert/cover directives and endpoints will be disabled. It
will not, however, affect any HDL code which was present in
a PSL metacomment or in a vunit.

1. transcript1
   The -nopsl is not used during compile or simulation.
   This will display the TEST and VUNIT messages and evaluate assertions A_V and A_E.
2. transcript2
   The -nopsl switch is only used during simulation.
   This will display both the TEST and VUNIT messages.
3. transcript3
   The -nopsl switch is used only during compile.
   This will display only the VUNIT messages and evaluate assertion A_V.
4. transcript3
   The -nopsl switch is used during compile and simulation.
   This will display only the VUNIT messages.
